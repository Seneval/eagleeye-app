# Fixes Applied to EagleEye App

## 1. CSS Error Fix (Sentry Issue EAGLEEYE-APP-2)
**Problem**: The `border-border` class was causing a build error because of inconsistent color definitions.
**Solution**: Updated `tailwind.config.js` to use direct hex values instead of CSS variables for colors.

## 2. Goals Creation Error (400 Error)
**Problem**: The goals form was sending duplicate fields (`targetDate` and `target_date`) causing validation errors.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the data structure being sent to Supabase
- Added default date values when the component loads
- Removed duplicate `getDefaultDate` function

## 3. Business Information Enhancement
**Problem**: The AI bots needed more context about the user's business.
**Solution**: Added new fields to business_context:
- `business_description`: Detailed description of the business
- `products_services`: Array of products/services offered
- `value_proposition`: What makes the business unique
- `business_model`: How the business generates revenue

## Database Migration Required

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add new columns to business_context table
ALTER TABLE business_context 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS business_description TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS products_services JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS value_proposition TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS business_model TEXT;
```

## Files Modified
1. `/tailwind.config.js` - Fixed color definitions
2. `/components/goals/GoalForm.js` - Fixed form submission
3. `/components/context/ContextForm.js` - Added business info fields
4. `/lib/ai/prompts.js` - Updated AI context to include business info

## Testing Steps
1. Apply the database migration
2. Restart the development server
3. Go to Dashboard > Business Context
4. Fill in the new Business Information section
5. Try creating a new goal to verify the fix
6. Chat with AI bots to see they now have full business context
